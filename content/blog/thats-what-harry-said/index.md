# What is Sexuality

<p>Sexuality is about your sexual feelings, thoughts, attractions and behaviours towards other people. You can find other people physically, sexually or emotionally attractive, and all those things are a part of your sexuality. You don't have any control over that. It just happens. There is no such thing as a man with a lady brain because men and women have the same brain. Yes. Men and women have the same brains. They act differently because they are socialized to, not because they are born thinking pink dresses are prettier.</p>
<p>Some women are masculine while some men are feminine, not a big deal, masculine and feminine are just personality traits. Woman with short hair doesn't make her man just like that man who likes to wear dresses are not woman.</p>

# Different Type of Sexualities

There are around 46 sexualities out there. Out of which LGBTQ has gained the most of the attention. If you don't know what LGBTQ stands for then here is the brief introduction to them:<br>
_**L**esbian_: Female who is romantically, erotically and sexually attracted to other females only falls under this category.<br>
_**G**ay_: Male who is romantically and sexually attracted to other males only falls under this category.<br>
_**B**isexual_: Person who is emotionally, romantically and physically attracted to a man, woman or any other gender is considered as bisexual.<br>
_**T**ransgender_: A person whose gender and sense of personal identity does not correspond with their birth sex. For example, a boy might think he is a girl trapped in the wrong body.<br>
_**Q**ueer_: Use of the word queer opens up options beyond lesbian, gay, and bisexual to individuals who do not fit neatly into these categories or prefer a category that isn't dependent on sex and gender.<br>

# Why not to make big deal out of it

Sexual orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction (or a combination of these) to persons of the opposite sex or gender, the same sex or gender, or to both sexes or more than one gender.
These attractions are involuntary and controlling them by mere action of bad mouthing is just stupid. Anyone in 21st century with certain goals and aspirations should be given a chance to be what they are, the mere act of respecting their choices ,their sexuality is the least one can ask from human-kind.<br>
Research suggests that sexual orientation is independent of cultural and other social influences, but that open identification of one's sexual orientation may be hindered by homophobic/heterosexist settings.<br>
India has never been inviting of the fact that loving a person is all that matters and not the gender identity . The jokes and memes about a perticular sexuality are just hurtful. Since birth we been asked to dream big, be the best version of yourself if we aren't even allowed to live them then what was the point of that.
What's making people of LGBTQ+ angry is that the fact people are so ignorant that they think they have a say in someone else's life, the ignorance to choices which they think are best for their growth, their right to select, the right to freedom to choose whom to love and when.<br>
Indian's first openly gay athele Dutee Chand said **_"felt like didn't belong to this world"_** shows how inconsiderate and illiberal we have become, she has risen from poverty to Indian's fastest woman the journey hasn't been easy, she has been banned and asked to leave events is this how you treat a person?<br>
As the next generation all we can do is define boundaries, acknowledge choices and respect everyone.

# Why you need to change your mindset

Imagine as a parent what if your child comes to you one pleasant evening and tells you that s/he isn't heterosexual. That won't be something you had thought about. But now you have options in front of you:

<ol>
<li>Accept it and support him/her.</li>
<li>Beat your child and kick him/her out of your house.</li>
</ol>
Most Indian parents choose option-2 as an impulsive decision because now they are worried about things like, Did they do something wrong? Will they have a grandchild? But such questions are irrelevant because sexuality doesn't come from upbringing and you can always adopt someone as your grandchild.<br>
What happens after you choose option-2? Your child would start feeling that the problem is within. This will take him/her into the depression phase. Where there is depression there are drugs, your child might start abusing drugs and end up in jail. This all will result in failure and every parent wants their child to be happy and successful. But now your one decision had ruined your child's like and your wish too.<br>
What if you choose option-1? It will help your child to fight with society to protect his/her sexuality. And most importantly it would avoid all the results which would have been caused if you had chosen option-2. This way your child would be able to live his/her life happily without worrying about that their parents think about their sexuality.<br>

# How to know about your sexuality

Identifying sexuality for an individual is quite difficult, as everyone is unique and their physical and emotional expectations are different. The prominent sexualities which people are trying identify themselves are straight, gay, lesbian, transgender and queer.<br>
Its upon the person to discover the options one is avail to.For someone out there who is confused and feel detached from all these emotions don't worry, asexuality has also been found to be one of the major choices out there.<br>
People who are confused and can't narrow down on anything, you have time, experiment, have fun there are so many beautiful things which you haven't read about, you haven't seen or heard, go out there and seize every opportunity.<br>
Sexuality is complex and before solidifying and judging someone's sexuality we should step back and take a good look at ourselves.
